			<h1>Preventive Dentistry </h1>
			<p>Some patients present with a higher than usual cavity rate, often called "rampant decay." We have special protocols to address these problems in an attempt to slow or stop future decay so patients can maintain their natural teeth as long as possible.</p>
			
			<h1>Night Guards/Occlusal Guards</h1>
			<p>We provide customized bite guards that prevent the destruction of your teeth caused from excessive grinding.</p>
			
			<h1>TMJ Dysfunction/Myofacial Pain Dysfunction</h1>
			<p>Whether painful joints or muscles, we are trained to diagnose and treat many of these maladies. </p>
			
			<h1>Dentures-Complete and Partials</h1>
			<p>Are you missing a few or all teeth? Correctly designed partial and complete dentistry can restore your ability to chew as well as give a natural appearance. We also provide immediate insertions of complete dentures, so patients receive their dentures on the same day teeth are extracted.</p>
			
			<h1>Cosmetic Dentistry</h1>
			<p>We provide bleaching, veneers, crowns, and posterior tooth-colored restorations which can drastically improve your smile. ZOOM bleaching is available in-office for those who want bleaching done in about 1 hour.</p>
			
			<h1>Periodontal Dentistry</h1>
			<p>Periodontal disease is the number one cause of tooth loss in the United States. We screen every patient for periodontal disease and can treat many cases in our office.</p>
			
			<h1>Root Canal Treatment</h1>
			<p>Severely broken down and/or abscessed teeth many times can be saved by removing the nerve and source of infection then restoring the top of the tooth. Our office uses conventional endodontic therapy, a time-proven and highly reliable treatment modality.</p>
			
			<h1>Implants</h1>
			<p>If youâ€™re missing one or many teeth, dental implants may be the best treatment option.  Implants are long-term tooth replacements that allow you to fill spaces from missing teeth without resting on the gums, like a removable partial denture or grinding on teeth on either side of the missing tooth.  Implants are pain free and easy to place.  We can place and restore implants in our office. </p>
			
			<h1>Oral Surgery/Extractions</h1>
			<p>Most simple and surgical extractions can be completed in our office.</p>
