			<p>Our number one goal is to provide the highest quality care to our patients. To do that, we offer a <strong>comprehensive approach to dentistry</strong>, including a full range of preventative and corrective dental treatment options. We deliver this care through the latest techniques and long-proven procedures and approaches. But, more importantly, we work from a foundation of three very important values:</p>
			
			<p><strong>Integrity:</strong> We're straightforward and straight talkers. We recognize that the best way to grow a successful practice is to be honest from diagnosing the problem to providing choices for you to select the best treatment options.  We believe in doing what's best and remembering what matters.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Service:</strong> We strive to make every visit the best it can be. To add that little something extra that makes you feel at home.  And should you have an emergency and you’re one of our regular patients, we’ll make sacrifices to help you.  </p>
			
			<p><strong>Care:</strong> We listen to your concerns…carefully. We make a treatment plan together. And we always follow-up - we feel better when you feel better. These aren't just words in our handbook or manual. They represent how we act. Our state of mind. What our practice embodies every day.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Feeling nervous?</strong><br> We know some patients come to our office with concerns - from worry about their dental health to questions about how they'll pay for procedures to fear about pain or discomfort. Whatever you're anxious about, we're here to help. Talk to us about what's on your mind and - together - we'll find a solution.</p>
